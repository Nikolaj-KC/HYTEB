Welcome to HYTEB's documentation!
=================================
This is the official documentation for the ``HYTEB``.
This document aims at guiding the documenting and the usage.

What is HYTEB?
--------------
HYTEB is a set of python modules for user-friendly software for analysing the data worth of geophysics (electromagnetic data) for improving the predictive capability of groundwater models.

Authors
-------
``HYTEB`` is developed by Nikolaj Kruse Christensen as part as his Ph.D. project, under
supervision of Steen Christensn, all of the Department
of Geoscience, Aarhus University, Denmark. The author welcomes interested third
party developers. This document is a work in progress.

Documentation
-------------
The goal is selv-documenting code in sphinx, so no manual will be available.
