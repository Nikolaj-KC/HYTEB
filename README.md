# HYTEB (HYdrogeophysical TEst-Bench)

Welcome to HYTEB's documentation!
=================================
This is the official documentation for the ``HYTEB``.
This document aims at guiding the documenting andthe usage.

``HYTEB`` is developed by Nikolaj Kruse Christensen as part as his Ph.D. project, under
supervision of Steen Christensn, all of the Department
of Geoscience, Aarhus University, Denmark. The author welcomes interested third
party developers. This document is a work in progress.

Python modules
==============
The Python module ``HYTEB`` is intended as the main interface to ...
It is recommended to use this module for simulation setup,
simulation execution, and analysis of the simulation output data.

In order to use the API, the file ``HYTEB.py`` must be placed in the same
directory as the Python files. 

Contents:
---------
   hydro_module
   geophys_module
   inversion_module
   load_write
   

Sample usage
------------
Below is a simple, annotated example of how to setup, execute, and post-process
a ``sphere`` simulation.  The example is also found in the ``python/`` folder as
``collision.py``.
